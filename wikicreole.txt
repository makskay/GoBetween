== GoBetween: switch worlds without losing your place ==

=== GoBetween makes teleporting between worlds easy ===
* After traveling to each world that you can access at least once, you'll be able to return to your last known location in each of these worlds by typing ///go <world-name>//.
* As a server administrator, you can enable "worldgroups" in config.yml. This powerful feature allows you to treat multiple worlds as if they're one and the same when ///go// is used. 
* Players who use /go to teleport to a grouped world will be directed to the saved location for the worldgroup of which that world is a member - preventing players from "bypassing" your worldgroup settings.

=== GoBetween is flexible and easy to configure ===
* By default, GoBetween will automatically keep itself up to date with the version available on BukkitDev. Automatic updates can be easily disabled by editing a single line in config.yml.
* You can specifically disallow players from teleporting into certain worlds via the /go command by editing the list of "ignored worlds" in config.yml.

=== GoBetween is under active development ===
* GoBetween plays a central role on the server I administrate. As long as it's relevant, I'll keep this plugin updated and add new features as I see fit :)
