== GoBetween: switch worlds without losing your place ==

=== GoBetween makes teleporting between worlds easy ===
* After traveling to each world that you can access at least once, you'll be able to return to your last known location in each of these worlds by typing ///go <world-name>//.
* As a server administrator, you can enable "worldgroups" in the config.yml file. This powerful feature allows you to treat multiple worlds as if they're one and the same when ///go// is used.

=== GoBetween is under active development ===
* GoBetween plays a central role on the server I administrate. As long as it's relevant, I'll keep this plugin updated and add new features as I see fit :)
* I'm currently working on implementing auto-installation of updates from dev.bukkit.org, allowing this plugin to keep itself up to date without any work on the part of server admins.
