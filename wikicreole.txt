== GoBetween: switch worlds without losing your place ==

== What is GoBetween? ==

=== GoBetween makes teleporting between worlds easy ===
After traveling to each world that you can access at least once, you'll be able to return to your last known location in each of these worlds by typing ///go <world-name>//.

=== GoBetween understands that your worlds are grouped ===
As a server administrator, you can enable "worldgroups" in the config.yml file. This powerful feature allows you to treat multiple worlds as if they're one and the same when ///go// is used.

== What else should I know about GoBetween? ==

=== GoBetween won't be abandoned any time soon ===
GoBetween plays a central role on the server I administrate. As long as it's relevant, I'll keep this plugin updated and add new features as I see fit :)
