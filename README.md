# Wanderlust
Wanderlust is a lightweight Bukkit plugin that logs a player's location when he changes worlds, thereby enabling him to later return directly to that same location.

## Configuration
This plugin currently provides no configurable options. In the future, it may offer support for "world groups" - multiple  worlds that are treated as one for teleportation purposes. This would allow administrators to, for example, "bind together" a survival world and its nether counterpart, storing only one location per user for both worlds.
